## ABOUT:

NSSO Data Analysis - Consumption Pattern of Meghalaya using R and Python

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Using the provided data, you must create an Excel file with the state assigned to you. Name it and then import it into Excel. Subset the variables assigned to you and perform the following operations using the software. You must discuss your results.

- Check if there are any missing values in the data, identify them, and if there are, replace them with the mean of the variable.
- Check for outliers, describe your test’s outcome, and make suitable amendments.
- Rename the districts and sectors, viz., rural and urban.
- Summarize the critical variables in the data set region-wise and district-wise and indicate the top and bottom three districts of consumption.
- Test whether the differences in the means are significant or not.

Use the dataset [data “NSSO68.csv”]

## FINAL INFERENCE:

This study analyzes the consumption patterns in Meghalaya by leveraging NSSO data. Utilizing Python and R for data cleaning, summarization, and statistical testing, we aim to provide insights that can help policymakers in fostering balanced development and crafting targeted interventions across different districts. This will aid in making informed decisions and efficient resource distribution.

Our analysis reveals a significant difference in consumption between rural and urban sectors in Meghalaya. Urban consumption in Meghalaya is significantly higher than in its rural areas. This highlights the need for focused development initiatives to address the consumption disparity and promote equitable growth across the state.
